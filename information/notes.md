    - nt/yh/zs
        - ny >= z
        - t - executions
        - h - hardware channels
        - s - software versions
    - criterium:
        - consistency of conditions and inputs
        - reliable decision algorithm
            - could also be multiplied
    - faults:
        - simplex: only one execution affected
        - "M" faults:
            - independent
                - avoid by using different designs for each version (1T/NH/NS)
                - no common cause
            - related
            - design faults
        - similiar faults don't mean the same cause
    - NVP
        - decision algorithm is a generic consesus
        - initial specification
            - the function
            - cross-check-points
            - cross-check-vectors
                - at each ccpoint
            - decision algorithm at cc points
            - response to the decision
        - experiment examples:
            - airport scheduler
                - transactional problem
                - TODO: check results/specification

    - 3 version failure probability
        - P = p^3 + 3p^2(1-p)
            - poor predictor
    - The problem
        - automated factory
    - voting algorithms
        - goal is to reduce "false" identical failures
        - 1. Composite/Version
            - group output into fields
            - find majority in groups
            - give counter values based on matches with majority fields
            - winner based on counter values, if equal take the first
        - 2. Weighted Composite/Version
            - same as 1., but weight groups when calculating counter values 
        - 3. Composite:
            - no counter values
            - fields, where there is no majority are filled with version 1
            - might vote false result, which matches no version's output
        - 4. History:
            - vote based on history
                - the version winning the most majority votes in the last 500 or so executions will win
        - 5. Acceptance test:
            - Pass in versions decreasing in reliability, the first that satisfies the conditions wins

        - Results:
            - 5. is best
            - First 3. are nearly the same
